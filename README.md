## . This code assessment's doc was saying multiple things 
		1. sub-topics : do we have here only topic OR topic and sub-topic entity both
		2. Topic which are linked with : a Topic can have multiple parents or not
   . I assumed the assessment with single entity Topic which can have multiple children and multiple parents. I have solved assessment following this only.
		
## Please find DDL as below :
	1. create table topic (id integer generated by default as identity, name varchar(255), primary key (id));
	2. create table topic_references_to (references_from_id integer not null, references_to_id integer not null, primary key (references_from_id, references_to_id));
	3. alter table topic_references_to add constraint FKml4w8u5l3lml9qs3kmwiy2x4h foreign key (references_to_id) references topic
	4. alter table topic_references_to add constraint FKdtfrnjhltngh7lbjn869dhx13 foreign key (references_from_id) references topic
	
## DUMMY DATA 
	INSERT INTO topic(id,name) VALUES (1, 'first');
	INSERT INTO topic(id,name) VALUES (2, 'second');
	INSERT INTO topic(id,name) VALUES (3, 'third');
	insert into TOPIC(id,name) values (4, 'fourth');
	insert into TOPIC(id,name) values (5, 'fifth');
	insert into TOPIC(id,name) values (6, 'sixth');
	insert into TOPIC(id,name) values (7, 'seventh');
	insert into TOPIC(id,name) values (8, 'eighth');
	insert into TOPIC(id,name) values (9, 'nine');
	insert into TOPIC(id,name) values (10, 'ten');

	insert into TOPIC_REFERENCES_TO values(8,9);
	insert into TOPIC_REFERENCES_TO values(7,10);
	insert into TOPIC_REFERENCES_TO values(10,11);
   
## Please find SQL as below :
	1) find all Topic which are linked with at least three Topics :
	  select * from TOPIC where id in (select ft.REFERENCES_TO_ID from TOPIC_REFERENCES_TO ft group by ft.REFERENCES_TO_ID having count(distinct ft.REFERENCES_FROM_ID) > 2);
	  
	2) find all Topic which are having one child and one parent :
		select * from TOPIC where id in (select ft.REFERENCES_TO_ID from TOPIC_REFERENCES_TO ft group by ft.REFERENCES_TO_ID having count(distinct ft.REFERENCES_FROM_ID) = 1) and 
		id in (select ft.REFERENCES_FROM_ID from TOPIC_REFERENCES_TO ft group by ft.REFERENCES_FROM_ID having count(distinct ft.REFERENCES_TO_ID) = 1);
		
	3)  find all Topic which are placed at 3rd level in the hierarchy : 
		select * from TOPIC t where t.ID in (select trt4.REFERENCES_TO_ID from TOPIC_REFERENCES_TO trt4 where trt4.REFERENCES_FROM_ID in (select trt1.REFERENCES_TO_ID from TOPIC_REFERENCES_TO trt1 where trt1.REFERENCES_FROM_ID not in (select distinct trt2.REFERENCES_TO_ID from TOPIC_REFERENCES_TO trt2)));
